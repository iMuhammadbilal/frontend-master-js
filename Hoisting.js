// Hoisting in JavaScript
// Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.
// This means that you can use variables and functions before they are declared in the code. However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations.
// This can lead to unexpected behavior if not understood properly. Let's explore hoisting with examples and real-world scenarios.
